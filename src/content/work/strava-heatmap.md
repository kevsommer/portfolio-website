## Strava Heatmap Animation App
This app is inspired by a <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/f8nu0c/oc_this_is_how_londons_street_grid_reveals_using/'>reddit post</a> from a couple of years ago, in which a London-based cyclist, mapped all of his bike rides over the course of 5 years and displayed them chronologically in a video. As a passionate runner and avid Strava user, I had the idea of developing a web app, that allows Strava users to do the same thing without technical knowledge of programs like QGIS.

### Strava API
Conveniently, Strava allows developers to use a public API, which can be seamlessly integrated into any kind of project. Using OAuth2 users can authenticate themselves and the web app can get all of the activities with the corresponding polylines.### Strava API
